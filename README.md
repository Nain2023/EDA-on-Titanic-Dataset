Project Overview

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the RMS Titanic. The goal of the analysis is to uncover patterns and insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival during the tragic sinking of the ship in 1912.

By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the project highlights correlations between features like gender, age, socio-economic status, and survival rates.

Tools Used

    Python: For data manipulation and analysis.
    Pandas: For data cleaning and transformation.
    Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
    Jupyter Notebook: For organizing the analysis and visualizations.

Findings

1.	Overall Survival:
  •	The majority of passengers did not survive, reflecting the tragic nature of the event.
2.	Impact of Passenger Class (Pclass):
  •	First-class passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to second and third-class passengers.
  •	Third-class passengers had the lowest survival rate, suggesting that socio-economic status played a crucial role in access to     lifeboats and survival resources.
3.	Gender and Survival:
  •	Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than male passengers.
  •	This aligns with the “women and children first” policy during the evacuation, showing gender as an important factor in            survival.
4.	Age and Survival: 
  •	Children (younger passengers) had a higher survival rate compared to adults.
  •	Older passengers, particularly those above 50 years, had a lower chance of survival, possibly due to physical limitations in      the evacuation process.
5.	Fare and Survival:
  •	A higher fare paid for the ticket was positively correlated with survival. Passengers who paid higher fares (mostly first-        class) had better survival rates.

Conclusion

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset revealed significant insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival. The findings show that survival rates were not random, but closely related to socio-economic status, gender, age, and even family structure.
